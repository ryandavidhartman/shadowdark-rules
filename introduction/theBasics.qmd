## Intro
If this is your first time playing Shadowdark RPG, it’s helpful to start with a premade character. The free digital [Shadowdark RPG Quickstart Set](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/products/shadowdark-rpg-quickstart-set-pdf?srsltid=AfmBOopZSDaNPKNQ4FuC48dqahZUSUGWL648cvMfTSm3XrzzoYWt-KU4) has a few!

## Characters
You decide your character’s actions and tell them to the referee, or Game Master (**GM**).

The GM determines if your actions are successful and describes the results.

This back-and-forth between you, the GM, and your adventuring companions grows and shapes the game world.

Always ask yourself: If you were really your character, what would you do right now?

## Actions
On your **turn**, describe an **action** you want to do. For example, you could say you’re going to shoot your bow at a troll.

The GM might ask you to do a **check** (see Checks) to determine whether your action succeeds.

## Movement
During your turn, you can **move** up to **near** (roughly 30 feet). You can break this movement up in any way  If you don’t take an action, you can move near again.

## Rounds
Each person takes a turn, starting with the GM and going clockwise. The GM controls the monsters and environment and narrates how everyone’s actions change the game world.  Once everyone has taken a turn,
that completes one **round**. Then, a new round begins.

## Dice
You'll need a four-sided (**d4**), six-sided (**d6**), eight-sided (**d8**), ten-sided (**d10**), twelve-sided (**d12**) and twenty-sided (**d20**) die.

**Multiples.** 3d6 = three six-sided dice. Roll them together and add them.

**Advantage.** Roll two times and use the better result.

**Disadvantage.** Roll two times and use the worse result.

## Stats
Stats are your characteristics.  Each stat goes from 3-18 and has a bonus or penalty (called a **modifier**, or MOD) from -4 to +4.

**Strength.** Physical power.

**Dexterity.** Agility, reflexes.

**Constitution.** Endurance, resistance to injury.

**Intelligence.** Logical ability.

**Wisdom.** Instinct, willpower.

**Charisma.** Appeal, presence.

## Checks
When attempting a risky action, roll a d20 and add a modifier. That’s called making a **check**.

The GM chooses the check's linked stat and a number called a difficulty class (**DC**). If the total of your d20 roll + stat modifier equals or beats the DC, your action succeeds.

For example, the GM might say leaping over a narrow chasm requires a DC 9 Strength check.

## Hit Points
Injuries cause you to take **damage** and lose hit points (**HP**). Typical weapons deal 1d6 damage to your HP You regain lost HP after a night of rest.

Characters at zero HP **die** in 1d4 + Constitution modifier (minimum 1) rounds. Dead characters are retired from play!

## What's Next?
You could play a whole game with just the basics. But once you're ready for more, the next chapters expand upon them.

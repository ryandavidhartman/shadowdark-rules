# Welcome

_The torches sputtered in the damp corridor as **Vakesh** ran a hand along the carved wall, tracing ancient sigils worn nearly smooth.  “Luck favors the bold,” he muttered—though his tone carried the unease of a man who had wagered his last coin on that truth one too many times._

_Behind him, **Torin** adjusted his grip on his war axe.  “Luck favors the prepared,” the dwarf growled. “And you’ve yet to pay me back for the last round of ale, wizard.”_

_**Carisby**, ever the opportunist, crouched beside a stone chest half-buried in dust.  “If it makes you feel better, Torin, I’m about to find us all a payday.”  His nimble fingers danced across the lock—*click*—and a faint mist hissed from the seams._

_**Rosalin** stepped forward, mace raised, eyes narrowing as the vapor thickened.  “Trap. Back!”_

_Too late—the halfling sprang away, coughing as the air shimmered with necrotic light. The runes on the chest flared green, and a figure of ghostly radiance rose before them: a skeletal priest in tattered finery, clutching a pair of dice carved from bone._

_“Roll… and your fate is sealed,” it rasped. Vakesh’s grin returned. “Now *this* is a game I understand.”  He reached into his robes and drew forth a pair of gem-inlaid dice—an old gambler’s charm from his wilder years. As they clattered across the flagstones, the undead priest mirrored the motion. Both sets rolled in eerie unison. The priest’s dice came up snake eyes.  Vakesh’s—double sixes._

_A sudden rush of spectral wind swept through the corridor. The ghostly priest bowed stiffly, fading into dust. The chest’s lid cracked open with a low moan, revealing a heap of ancient gold coins and a ring that shimmered with unholy light._

_Torin whistled low. “Ain’t often I see the gods smile on a cheat.”_

_Rosalin frowned, her cleric’s instincts uneasy. “That ring—best leave it be. Evil clings to it.”  Carisby was already pocketing coins. “Evil can wait till after supper.”  Vakesh eyed the ring but said nothing. The dice in his palm felt warm *too* warm. He smiled a gambler’s smile, the kind that hides more than it shows._

_“Onward, **Scimitars**,” he said. “The night is young, and fortune’s still rolling.”  They disappeared deeper into the tomb, laughter echoing through the corridors—reckless, brilliant, and utterly free._
